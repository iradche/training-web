## Overview

This intensive, practical, five day course is an introduction to the technical, commercial and legal aspects of open data. It aims to  highlight key opportunities for working with open data and how they can be exploited across government, business and society.


The course is designed to enable anyone to understand how to publish, consume and exploit open data as well as give an understanding of best practice, law, licensing and policy issues.


Key to the course is for participants to gain hands on experience through the week. This will culminate in a team brief for a Hack Day, with help from experienced mentors.
